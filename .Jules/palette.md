## 2024-03-22 - [Accessibility] Color Contrast in Data Viz
**Learning:** High-contrast colors are critical for data visualization, especially for large numbers. Standard "Gold" (#FFD700) and "Orange" (#FF8C00) on white backgrounds fail WCAG AA contrast requirements (1.4:1 and 2.3:1 respectively).
**Action:** Use darker shades like Dark Goldenrod (#B8860B, 3.25:1) and Pumpkin (#D35400, 4.17:1) for text, while keeping the original colors for backgrounds or accents if needed.
